#JAVASCRIPT 30

----

I'm taking the **#JavaScript30 challenge** with [Wes Bos JavaScript30 course](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30 "JavaScript30"). I hope that by documenting my daily progress here, I will be able to stick to this commitment and build up JavaScript and Problem Solving Skills.


##DAY 1: JAVASCRIPT DRUM KIT
*15th MAY 2019*

-----

Today I built a fun drum kit using JavaScript! I have done this project before during my first attempt at the **JavaScript30**. But, I decided to do it myself without going through the videos and I was able to complete it within 10 minutes!

###LEARNINGS

+ I got to learn and use <http://keycode.info/>, a site for finding the keycode of the keys on the keyboard
+ Got introduced to _transitionend_ event
+ solidified my understanding of _event handling_
